I couldn't figure out how *not* to download all ~sources~ before building, and you really don't wanna do that with multiple gigabytes of data.

Just ~python generate.py~. This will overwrite the individual ~PKGBUILD~ files and commit them. Then just go through the ~models/~ subdirectory and build/push.

E.g.:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
for dir in *; do makepkg -f && git -C "$dir" push origin master; done
#+END_SRC
